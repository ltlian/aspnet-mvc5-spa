# ASP.NET MVC5 with a single-page frontend application

This project demonstrates how one could migrate a legacy .NET framework MVC application to use a cookie-authenticated single-page web application as its frontend.

The React frontend project can be found at <https://github.com/ltlian/aspnet-mvc5-spa-client>

For now, see the commit log for the necessary changes.
